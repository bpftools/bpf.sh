bpf.sh
------

::: {.section}
I\'m not sure yet what to do with this domain, some ideas I have for it
are:

-   ~~Actually run a mail forwarding services for cool people in the BPF
    space would love a bpf.sh email address!~~ - **Done!** If you want
    one, **write me an email** telling me more about your journey with
    BPF!
-   Have a docker registry like r.bpf.sh/yourimage for container images
    that are actually related to bpf programs
-   ~~Make a little collection of interesting BPF resources, books,
    whatever in the main website~~ Started!
-   Run a vanity domain for go packages like **go.bpf.sh**, I would love
    to use it for [kubectl
    trace](https://github.com/fntlnz/kubectl-trace) for example

I\'m open to suggestions! Reach me out on twitter
[\@fntlnz](https://twitter.com/fntlnz) or write me at

``` {style="display: inline"}
lo at bpf.sh
```

and let me know what you think!
